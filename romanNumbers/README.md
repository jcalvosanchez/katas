# Roman Numerals Kata

This is a coding exercise (kata) designed to practice small algorithms like converting Roman numerals to natural digits and vice versa.

## Description of the Problem:

- The Romans wrote numbers using letters : I, V, X, L, C, D, M. (notice these letters have lots of straight lines and are hence easy to hack into stone tablets)
- We have adopted arabic digits (0, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000) and used base 10.

### Features:
- **Roman numerals to Natural Base 10 Conversion**: Convert Roman numerals (e.g., "XIV") into natural numbers (e.g., 14).
- **Natural Base 10 to Roman numerals Conversion**: Convert natural numbers (e.g., 14) into Roman numerals (e.g., "XIV").

## Description of the Solution:

Each branch contains a solution to this problem.

- **Master**. At the moment, it contains a very old solution provided using Java8 with an old Spring Test solution using jUnit.
